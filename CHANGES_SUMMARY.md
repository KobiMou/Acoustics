# Changes Summary: Distance-Specific to Sensor-Specific Leak Detection

## Overview
The leak detection system has been changed from **distance-specific** to **sensor-specific** analysis. This ensures that each sensor's data is analyzed independently using only its own NoLeak baseline, preventing cross-contamination between sensors.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Analysis Function Renamed and Restructured
- **Before**: `analyze_leak_detection_distance_specific()`
- **After**: `analyze_leak_detection_sensor_specific()`

### 2. Grouping Logic Changed
- **Before**: Grouped data by distance (extracted from filename patterns like "5m", "10m")
- **After**: Groups data by sensor ID (extracted from base filename before "_leak" or "_noleak")

### 3. Baseline Creation
- **Before**: Distance-specific baseline using all NoLeak measurements at the same distance
- **After**: Sensor-specific baseline using only that sensor's own NoLeak measurements

### 4. File Processing Requirements
- **Before**: Required distance pattern in filenames (e.g., "sensor_5m.wav")
- **After**: Processes all WAV files regardless of naming pattern

### 5. Excel Output Changes
- **Before**: "Distance_Specific_Detection" worksheet with "Distance (m)" column
- **After**: "Sensor_Specific_Detection" worksheet with "Sensor ID" column

### 6. Error Handling
- **Before**: "No NoLeak baseline available for {distance}m distance"
- **After**: "No NoLeak baseline available for sensor {sensor_id}"

## Benefits of Sensor-Specific Analysis

1. **Independent Analysis**: Each sensor is analyzed using only its own baseline data
2. **No Cross-Contamination**: Sensors at the same location don't share baseline data
3. **Accurate Results**: Each sensor's characteristics are preserved in the analysis
4. **Flexible File Naming**: No longer requires distance patterns in filenames
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more sensors without affecting existing analysis

## Impact on Results

- **Before**: If multiple sensors were at the same distance, they would share a common NoLeak baseline
- **After**: Each sensor uses only its own NoLeak measurements as baseline, ensuring independent analysis

## File Structure Requirements

Each sensor should have its own WAV file:
```
audio_data/
├── test_location1/
│   ├── sensor1.wav
│   ├── sensor2.wav
│   └── test_location1_analysis_summary.xlsx
├── test_location2/
│   ├── sensor1.wav
│   ├── sensor2.wav
│   └── test_location2_analysis_summary.xlsx
```
