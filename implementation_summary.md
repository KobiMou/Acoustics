# NoLeak Data Issues - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed SNR_Distance_dB for NoLeak Measurements ✅

**Location**: `main_11.py` lines 977-983 (approximately)

**Change**: Modified the distance-specific SNR calculation to set SNR_Distance_dB = 0 dB for NoLeak measurements instead of calculating them against their own baseline.

**Before**:
```python
# Calculate distance-specific SNR in dB
snr_distance_dB = 10 * np.log10(data['psd_avg'] / distance_noise_floor)
```

**After**:
```python
if data['is_noleak']:
    # NoLeak measurements should have 0 dB SNR against their own baseline
    snr_distance_dB = np.zeros_like(data['psd_avg'])
else:
    # Calculate distance-specific SNR in dB for potential leak measurements
    snr_distance_dB = 10 * np.log10(data['psd_avg'] / distance_noise_floor)
```

**Impact**: NoLeak measurements will now consistently show 0 dB SNR_Distance_dB values, which is theoretically correct since they represent the baseline noise floor.

### 2. Added Diagnostic Logging ✅

**Location**: Multiple locations in `main_11.py`

**Changes**:
- Added logging for distance-specific SNR calculation (lines ~973-976)
- Added logging for leak detection baseline counting (lines ~643-645)
- Added logging for NoLeak classification (lines ~408-410)

**Purpose**: Help identify why baseline counts might be 2 instead of 1 and verify correct NoLeak classification.

**Example Output**:
```
Distance 10m - NoLeak files: ['test_10m_sensor_noleak', 'test_10m_background_noleak']
Distance 10m - Baseline count: 2
Distance 10m - Total measurements: 4
Leak Detection - Distance 10m - NoLeak baseline files: ['test_10m_sensor_noleak', 'test_10m_background_noleak']
Leak Detection - Distance 10m - Baseline count: 2
Classified as NoLeak: test_10m_sensor_noleak
```

### 3. Enhanced NoLeak Classification Function ✅

**Location**: `main_11.py` lines 124-143 (approximately)

**Addition**: Created a more robust `is_noleak_measurement()` function that:
- Checks for multiple NoLeak indicators: `_noleak`, `noleak_`, `no_leak`, `baseline`, `background`
- Prevents false positives by checking for leak indicators that would override NoLeak classification
- Can be toggled on/off via the `use_enhanced_classification` flag

**Implementation**:
```python
def is_noleak_measurement(filename):
    """
    Determine if a measurement is a NoLeak baseline measurement
    More robust than simple substring matching
    """
    filename_lower = filename.lower()
    
    # Check for explicit noleak indicators
    noleak_indicators = ['_noleak', 'noleak_', 'no_leak', 'baseline', 'background']
    
    for indicator in noleak_indicators:
        if indicator in filename_lower:
            # Check for leak indicators that would override noleak
            leak_indicators = ['_leak', 'leak_', 'leakage']
            for leak_indicator in leak_indicators:
                if leak_indicator in filename_lower:
                    return False  # Leak indicator overrides noleak
            return True
    
    return False
```

**Usage**: Currently enabled by default (`use_enhanced_classification = True`) but can be disabled for backward compatibility.

## Expected Results

### For SNR_Distance_dB Issue:
- ✅ NoLeak measurements will show SNR_Distance_dB = 0 dB consistently
- ✅ Charts will display NoLeak reference lines at 0 dB as expected
- ✅ Distance-specific analysis will be more accurate and interpretable

### For Baseline Count Issue:
- ✅ Diagnostic logging will reveal which files are being classified as NoLeak
- ✅ Users can identify if multiple legitimate NoLeak measurements exist or if there's a classification error
- ✅ Enhanced classification function reduces false positives

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the updated code** on your existing dataset
2. **Check the console output** for the new diagnostic messages
3. **Verify SNR_Distance_dB values** are now 0 for NoLeak measurements
4. **Review the baseline count logs** to understand why counts might be 2
5. **Compare results** before and after the changes

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, the changes can be easily reverted:

1. **SNR Fix**: Change the conditional back to the original single line
2. **Logging**: Remove the print statements
3. **Classification**: Set `use_enhanced_classification = False`

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with your data
2. Review the diagnostic output to understand the baseline count issue
3. Adjust the NoLeak classification indicators if needed based on your filename patterns
4. Remove diagnostic logging once the issues are resolved (optional)
